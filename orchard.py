''' 
The general-purpose BCP user-level interface. This is the Python backend,
which communicates with the graphical client frontend in ./jsclient.

All peer communication and mutual hosting is handled by Python, which will
be capable of direct P2P communication and the high-level management of a
Kademlia DHT. Once that is in place, we can start building ECP support, and
start branching out to support more DHT algorithms.
