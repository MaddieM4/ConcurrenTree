Raw message layer
  Async
  Acked
    Type a, contains hash
    Must be sent to the same iface as it came from

Multipart
  Control message
    Contains sorted hash list
    Can be sent as a multipart
  p Messages
    Hash applies to contents
    Not applied until assembled based on control message

Operations
  Track 1
    Will not break verification if out of sync
    Type '1'
    Still subject to individual verification
    Version number indicates which track 2 block it works on
  Track 2
    Breaks verification if out of sync
    Community-verified with DDD
    Type '2'
    Version number indicates which version it aims to be
    Consists of a set of Track 1 op hashes and a single Track 2 op
      type: op
      version: 3
      includes: [Track1Hash1, Track1Hash2... Track2HashN]
      instructions: [...]
    Flattens the document afterwards
    It is perfectly legitimate to use a "blank" Track 2 op (instructions=[])
    just to flatten the document.

Digitally Distributed Democracy
  Integrated with permissions system
  Works on an interface basis
  An interface can trust other interfaces by percentages
  This only takes effect when the interface has manually gone offline
  Silence from a supposedly live interface can deadlock a vote
  Consensus is only necessary for Track 2 operations.
  Trust:
    drop
      threshold - percentage of dropper consensus necessary to drop this interface
      trusted   - Who an interface trusts as droppers

      If enough droppers agree and it surpasses the threshold, an interface can
      be put into offline mode without personally consenting.

    mod - Who an interface trusts when offline to validate Track 2 changes.
    online - boolean, marks whether interface is considered "online" or not.

    drop.trusted and mod are both dicts, keyed on interface, that contain dicts of
    trustedthing:amount, using interfaces and ints 0-100, respectively.
    Online is a dict of booleans keyed on interface.

  Document modification consensus
    For any document, W>=R and W+R>T
    Each interface has one natural "vote"
    Thus T=len(ifaces)
    Inside the permissions object, is a "consensus" property
      write: int
      read: int
    Any Track 2 that violates W>=R, W<=T, R<=T, or W+R>T is invalid and rejected
    ifaces are linked to identities with permissions.owners
      dict of iface:owner

      meta-meta: Can add interfaces to meta-meta, write-meta, and read-meta
